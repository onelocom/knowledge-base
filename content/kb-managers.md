## KB systems

* [Nb][nb]. CLI plain-text note-taking, bookmarking, and archiving with encryption, filtering and search, Git-backed versioning and syncing.
* [Neuron][neuron]. Future-proof and simple-to-use notes system based on Zettelkasten. 
* [Roam research][roam]. As easy to use as a document. As powerful as a graph database. Roam helps you organize your research for the long haul.
* [Amplenote][amplenote]. Flexible notes and tasks, built by productivity enthusiasts.
* [Slab][slab]. Focuses on editing. Knowledge will live in their platform, although they seem to provide an import/export solution. Something interesting: they have a bot/cron that you can set up to be notified to review if documentation has "expired".
* [Coda][coda]. Very strong solution (used by big companies). Closed platform. Provides automations (like ifttt). They seem to focus on decision documentation. And documents are alive (you can integrate a table that recalculates as soon as you add a new row, etc). 
* [Connected Papers][connpapers]. A web visual tool to navigate through related papers graphically.
* [Dendron][dendron]. An open-source, local-first, markdown-based, note-taking tool built on top of VSCode.


## Builders

* [Doctave][doctave]. A batteries-included developer documentation site generator.
* [GatsbyJS][gatsby]. Gatsby is a React-based open source framework for creating
  websites and apps.
* [Nanoc][nanoc]. Nanoc is a static-site generator, fit for building anything
  from a small personal blog to a large corporate website.
* [Promnesia][promnesia]. Promnesia is a browser extension that serves as a web
  surfing copilot by enhancing your browsing history, improving your web exploration
  experience, and integrating with your knowledge base

## Online Markdown Editor

* [Boosthub][boosthub]. Markdown editor with real time collaboration
* [Hackmd][hackmd]. Markdown editor with real time collaboration
